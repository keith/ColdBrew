This is a blatent ripoff of [caffeine][caffeine]. Luckily this has a retina and
dark mode compatible icon.

## Usage

- Left click to keep your display awake indefinitely.
- Right click to quick or open ColdBrew at login.

### Known Issues

- After toggling the menu a few times you have to right click the icon
after the menu closes to unhighlight the status bar icon. I think this
is a bug in Yosemite.
